# SubLim3 Nexus

SubLim3 Nexus is a modular tabletop companion platform designed for music, ambiance, RFID interaction, campaign management, and physical player companion devices.

The project is being rebuilt from scratch with a clean, reliable architecture inspired by previous projects:

* Phoniebox
* SubLim3 JukeBox
* Ambiance Book
* DnD Book
* DnD Player Cubes

SubLim3 Nexus is not designed as a Dungeons & Dragons-only tool. It is designed as a flexible RPG and tabletop platform that can support multiple game systems through templates, configurable resources, companion devices, and a central Nexus Core.

---

## Vision

SubLim3 Nexus is a physical tabletop ecosystem.

It combines:

* RFID music and ambiance playback
* Campaign management
* Game system templates
* Character tracking
* Companion devices
* Player-facing displays
* DM-to-player messaging
* Conditions, resources, and initiative
* Future mobile app support

The long-term goal is to create a universal physical RPG companion platform.

---

## Core Concepts

### Nexus Core

The Nexus Core is the central hub.

Responsibilities:

* Host the web interface
* Store campaign data
* Manage game systems
* Manage characters
* Register companion devices
* Sync companion devices
* Manage music and ambiance
* Handle RFID events
* Provide REST APIs
* Serve local dashboard pages

The media player is available at `/media/`. Nexus Core persists its folder-based
library and global playback state. Paired Admin and GM browsers can upload audio,
create and organize folders, or import supported files from configured USB mount
roots. The first browser playback driver streams managed files and also provides
three procedural soundscapes and four one-shot effects as offline starter content.

The dashboard also manages system-neutral campaign characters. Each character has
a shareable local player view that combines live resources, conditions, GM notes,
scene information, and battle turn state without requiring a cloud connection.

Role-specific entry points are available at `/admin/`, `/gm/`, and `/player/`.
Admin and GM devices pair with installer-generated PINs; Player devices select a
campaign and character and receive a character-scoped session with a bounded
self-service health adjustment.
The Admin dashboard can inspect and revoke paired clients, rotate the GM PIN, and
monitor a read-only Live Session Overview with an emergency full-session reset.

The GM console now includes a live encounter builder: select campaign characters,
add or remove combatants during play, edit and reorder initiative, move forward or
backward through turns, reset the round, and apply damage, healing, or conditions.
Player views receive those changes immediately and highlight the active character's
turn, while retaining a polling fallback for local-network interruptions.

The first app-onboarding migration is also active: the GM console renders a
campaign-specific Player QR code and share link. Scanning it opens the Player
surface with that campaign selected so the player can choose a character. The
planned printed Quick Start, device-claim, app-download, and short-lived invitation
flows are specified in `docs/onboarding.md`; PINs remain a recovery fallback while
device enrollment is introduced.

Version 1.2 adds the first template contract. Installed game systems define typed
character fields, resources, condition vocabularies, companion pages, and actions.
Campaigns bind to one installed system; new characters receive its defaults and
record the template version that shaped them. Custom RPG and D&D 5e ship as the
first built-in templates, while the Admin dashboard exposes the installed library.

Version 1.3 adds reusable success/failure trackers and uses the first one for D&D
5e death saves. At zero HP, the GM can record successes, failures, natural 1s,
natural 20s, or reset the tracker. Three successes stabilize, three failures mark
the character dead, a natural 20 restores one HP, and healing clears the tracker.
Players see the live read-only result, and existing D&D characters are migrated
when Nexus Core starts.

Initial development may use Raspberry Pi hardware.

Long-term production hardware may use either:

* Custom Linux SBC hardware
* ESP32-S3 based embedded hardware
* Hybrid architecture depending on product direction

---

### Nexus Companion

The Nexus Companion is the player-facing physical device.

Previous prototypes were called Player Cubes.

Future hardware target:

* LILYGO T-Display-S3
* ESP32-S3
* 1.9 inch display
* Touch interface
* WiFi
* Optional battery
* Optional haptic feedback
* Optional speaker or buzzer

The companion device should not contain hard-coded D&D logic. It should receive its layout, pages, fields, resources, and actions from the Nexus Core.

---

### Game Systems

Game systems are templates.

Examples:

* Dungeons & Dragons
* Pathfinder
* Call of Cthulhu
* Cyberpunk RED
* Shadowrun
* Savage Worlds
* Custom RPG systems

Each system defines:

* Character fields
* Resources
* Conditions
* Dice rules
* Page layouts
* Default actions
* Optional initiative behavior

---

## Design Principles

1. Build clean from scratch.
2. Avoid hard-coded D&D assumptions.
3. Make all RPG logic template-driven.
4. Keep companion firmware generic.
5. Make APIs simple and stable.
6. Prefer reliable local networking.
7. Keep campaign data portable.
8. Design with future manufacturing in mind.
9. Prioritize reliability over complexity.
10. Make every feature work offline on the local network first.

## Companion Protocol

The companion should boot, connect to WiFi, and identify itself.

### Check-In Request

```json
{
  "companion_id": "nexus-c630",
  "device_type": "lilygo_t_display_s3",
  "firmware": "0.1.0",
  "battery": 86
}
```

### Check-In Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "assigned": true,
  "campaign_id": "lost_mines",
  "character_id": "sir_garrick",
  "layout": {},
  "state": {}
}
```

If unassigned:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "assigned": false,
  "message": "Open Companion Registration on Nexus Core."
}
```

---

## Companion UI Goals

The touch companion should support:

* Character portrait
* Character name
* Page indicator
* Health/resources
* Conditions
* Initiative status
* DM messages
* Sync status
* Battery status
* WiFi status

The UI should be driven by server-provided layout data.

---

---

## Commercialization Notes

If this becomes a commercial product, avoid depending on hobby-only assumptions.

Important considerations:

* Custom PCB
* Reliable power design
* Battery charging
* FCC/CE certification
* Enclosure design
* Firmware update mechanism
* Factory reset process
* Setup flow
* Documentation
* Support process

The companion device should eventually be a custom ESP32-S3 board.

The Nexus Core may start as Raspberry Pi-based but should remain abstract enough to move to custom hardware later.

---

## Project Status

SubLim3 Nexus is starting from scratch.

### Run the Phase 1 foundation

Nexus Core currently requires Node.js 20 or newer and has no third-party runtime dependencies.

```bash
npm start
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Configure it with `HOST`, `PORT`, and `NEXUS_DATA_DIR` environment variables.

```bash
npm test
```

The first working slice includes the system status endpoint, campaign CRUD, portable JSON storage, request validation, and API integration tests. See [the architecture notes](docs/architecture.md) for current boundaries and next steps.

Open the local dashboard at `http://<nexus-host>:3000/`. It provides live Core health, host storage and memory details, and campaign management without requiring internet access.

### Install on Raspberry Pi

Clone the repository to `/opt/sublim3-nexus`, then install the managed service:

```bash
cd /opt/sublim3-nexus
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer creates a restricted `nexus` service account, stores runtime data under `/var/lib/sublim3-nexus`, and enables Nexus Core at boot. Runtime settings can be changed in `/etc/default/sublim3-nexus`.

The installer also configures the Network Settings helper, generates Admin and GM PINs plus a Local Wi-Fi password, and prints them. Open `/settings/` to switch between the Nexus hotspot and Home Wi-Fi or toggle Bluetooth visibility. Re-run the installer after pulling a release that changes system services or access credentials.

```bash
systemctl status sublim3-nexus
journalctl -u sublim3-nexus -f
```

Current priority:

1. Finalize architecture
2. Create clean GitHub repository
3. Build Core foundation
4. Build generic API
5. Build LILYGO T-Display-S3 companion firmware
6. Avoid carrying forward technical debt from previous projects

---

## Project Philosophy

Build the platform first.

D&D is the first template, not the product.

The product is SubLim3 Nexus.
